# Cypress Template

This is a Cypress + TypeScript automation framework template for a small deterministic UI flow.

## Feature set

- Cypress + TypeScript setup
- Cypress-native custom commands for common user actions
- page modules that own selectors and keep spec files focused on behavior
- generic `DataFactory` helpers for repeatable UI data
- folder-level `README.md` guides and file-header comments for easier onboarding
- multi-environment runtime config with `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`
- env-based secret resolution with a replaceable `SecretProvider`
- built-in screenshots and videos on failure
- ESLint rules that keep selectors out of spec files
- bundled deterministic UI demo app and GitHub Actions workflow

## How it works

- tests live in `cypress/e2e/`
- shared Cypress commands live in `cypress/support/commands.ts`
- selectors and page-level helpers live in `cypress/support/pages/`
- runtime config is loaded from `config/runtime-config.ts`
- bundled demo app auto-starts during `npm test` and `npm run open` in local `dev` when the default local URL is in use
- screenshots and videos are written under `reports/`

## Project structure

```text
cypress-template
├── cypress
│   ├── e2e
│   └── support
├── config
├── demo-apps
├── scripts
├── .github
├── cypress.config.ts
└── package.json
```

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the example test.

```bash
npm test
```

In local `dev`, the template starts its bundled demo app automatically when the default local URL is still in use.

If you want the interactive Cypress runner:

```bash
npm run open
```

If you want to run the demo app manually for debugging:

```bash
npm run demo:ui
```

Default local values:

- UI base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- username: `tester`
- password: `Password123!`

## Environment and secrets

The template supports:

- `TEST_ENV=dev`
- `TEST_ENV=staging`
- `TEST_ENV=prod`

Runtime values are resolved in this order:

1. environment-specific variables such as `DEV_UI_BASE_URL`
2. generic variables such as `UI_BASE_URL`
3. built-in defaults from `config/environments.ts`

Credentials resolve the same way:

1. `DEV_APP_USERNAME` or `DEV_APP_PASSWORD`
2. `APP_USERNAME` or `APP_PASSWORD`
3. built-in defaults for the selected environment

For local overrides, copy:

```bash
.env.example
```

to:

```bash
.env
```

If you want to disable the bundled local demo app even in `dev`, use:

```bash
CY_DISABLE_LOCAL_DEMO_APP=true npm test
```

If your team later uses a real secret system, replace the implementation behind `config/secret-manager.ts`.

## Main commands

```bash
npm test
npm run open
npm run demo:ui
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run cy:run
```

## Reports and artifacts

Outputs:

- Cypress videos: `reports/videos`
- Cypress screenshots: `reports/screenshots`

The default Cypress terminal output is kept as the main reporting path.

## Add a new test

Create tests under `cypress/e2e/`.

Keep the pattern simple:

- create data with `DataFactory`
- interact through custom commands or page modules
- assert in the test

Example shape:

```ts
it("does something", () => {
  const dataFactory = new DataFactory("local");
  const person = dataFactory.person();

  cy.signIn("tester", "Password123!");
  cy.addPerson(person);
});
```

## Extend the framework

Common extension points:

- update or replace the bundled demo app under `demo-apps/`
- add page modules under `cypress/support/pages/`
- add shared custom commands in `cypress/support/commands.ts`
- extend generic data builders in `cypress/support/data/`
- add stronger lint rules in `eslint.config.mjs`

Recommended rules:

- keep selectors in support/page modules or custom commands
- keep assertions in spec files
- use Cypress commands for workflows, not giant helper classes
- keep the data layer generic until the project really needs domain-specific factories

## CI

The included workflow lives at:

```bash
.github/workflows/cypress-tests.yml
```

It installs dependencies, starts the bundled demo app, runs Cypress tests, and uploads screenshots and videos as artifacts.
