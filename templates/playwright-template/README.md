This is a Playwright + TypeScript automation framework template for UI and API tests.

## Feature set

- Playwright + TypeScript setup
- page object pattern with selectors kept out of tests
- shared fixtures for config, logging, data, and page objects
- generic data factory pattern with `DataFactory`
- folder-level `README.md` guides and file-header comments for easier onboarding
- multi-environment runtime config with `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`
- env-based secret resolution with a replaceable `SecretProvider`
- Playwright HTML report by default
- optional Allure single-file report
- traces, screenshots, videos, and structured logs for debugging
- ESLint rules that protect framework conventions
- GitHub Actions workflow and Docker support

## How it works

- tests import shared fixtures from `fixtures/test-fixtures.ts`
- page objects in `pages/` own locators and user actions
- runtime config is loaded from `config/runtime-config.ts`
- application URLs and credentials are resolved from `TEST_ENV`
- bundled demo apps auto-start during `npm test` in local `dev` mode when the default local URLs are in use
- reports and artifacts are written under `reports/`, `allure-results/`, and `test-results/`

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run tests.

```bash
npm test
```

In local `dev`, the template starts its bundled demo apps automatically before the tests run.

If you want to run the demo apps manually for debugging:

```bash
npm run demo:ui
```

```bash
npm run demo:api
```

Default local values:

- UI base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- API base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:3001`
- credentials: generated into local `.env` on first run

## Environment and secrets

The template supports:

- `TEST_ENV=dev`
- `TEST_ENV=staging`
- `TEST_ENV=prod`

Runtime values are resolved in this order:

1. environment-specific variables such as `DEV_UI_BASE_URL`
2. generic variables such as `UI_BASE_URL`
3. built-in defaults from `config/environments.ts`

The same pattern is used for credentials:

1. `DEV_APP_USERNAME` or `DEV_APP_PASSWORD`
2. `APP_USERNAME` or `APP_PASSWORD`
3. built-in empty defaults for the selected environment

For local overrides, copy:

```bash
.env.example
```

to:

```bash
.env
```

The template loads:

- `.env`
- `.env.<TEST_ENV>`

On the first local run, the template also creates a `.env` file with random demo credentials if one does not already exist.

Example:

```bash
TEST_ENV=staging \
STAGING_UI_BASE_URL=https://staging-ui.example.internal \
STAGING_API_BASE_URL=https://staging-api.example.internal \
STAGING_APP_USERNAME=my-user \
STAGING_APP_PASSWORD=my-password \
npx playwright test
```

If you want to disable the bundled local demo apps even in `dev`, use:

```bash
PW_DISABLE_LOCAL_DEMO_APPS=true npm test
```

If your team uses a real secret system later, replace the implementation behind `config/secret-manager.ts`.

## Main commands

```bash
npm test
npm run test:smoke
npm run test:regression
npm run test:critical
npm run demo:ui
npm run demo:api
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run report:playwright
npm run report:allure
```

## Reports and artifacts

Default Playwright HTML report:

```bash
npm run report:playwright
```

Optional Allure report:

```bash
npm run report:allure
```

Outputs:

- Playwright HTML: `reports/html`
- Allure single file: `reports/allure/index.html`
- structured event log: `reports/logs/playwright-events.jsonl`
- raw Allure results: `allure-results`
- traces, screenshots, videos: `test-results`

If you only want Playwright reporting, remove the `allure-playwright` reporter entry in `playwright.config.ts`.

## Add a new test

Create tests under `tests/` and import the shared fixtures:

```ts
import { expect, test } from '../fixtures/test-fixtures';
```

Keep the pattern simple:

- create data with `dataFactory`
- interact through page objects
- assert in the test

Example shape:

```ts
test('do something @smoke', async ({ dataFactory, loginPage }) => {
  const person = dataFactory.person();
  // use page objects here
});
```

## Extend the framework

Common extension points:

- update or replace the bundled demo apps under `demo-apps/`
- add page objects under `pages/`
- add reusable UI pieces under `components/`
- extend fixtures in `fixtures/test-fixtures.ts`
- add more generic builders under `data/factories/`
- add stronger custom lint rules in `lint/architecture-plugin.cjs`
- add custom reporters under `reporters/`

Recommended rules:

- keep selectors in page objects
- keep assertions in test files
- prefer semantic selectors such as `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, and `data-testid`
- keep the data layer generic until the project really needs domain-specific factories

## Template upgrades

This project includes a `.qa-patterns.json` metadata file so future CLI versions can compare the current project against the managed template baseline.

Check for available safe updates:

```bash
npx -y @toolstackhq/create-qa-patterns upgrade check .
```

Apply only safe managed-file updates:

```bash
npx -y @toolstackhq/create-qa-patterns upgrade apply --safe .
```

The upgrade flow is conservative. It updates framework infrastructure such as config, scripts, workflows, and package metadata when those files are still unchanged from the generated baseline. If you changed a managed file yourself, the CLI reports a conflict instead of overwriting it.

## CI and Docker

The CI entrypoint is:

```bash
scripts/run-tests.sh
```

Docker support is included in:

```bash
docker/Dockerfile
```

The included GitHub Actions workflow installs dependencies, runs tests, and uploads artifacts. The Docker path is also validated in CI so the container setup does not drift from the normal runner path.
